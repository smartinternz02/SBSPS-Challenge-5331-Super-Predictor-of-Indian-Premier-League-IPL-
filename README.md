# Super Predictor of Indian Premier League (IPL)

We have created a statistical and graphical dashboard of IPL using IBM Cognos Analytics and we have also created IPL score predictor using jupyter notebook.

To implement dashboard and score predictor we have aslo created a website where user can predict score as well as visualize dashboard.
